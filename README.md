RESO-DotNETClientWebApp
=======================

RESO API Web Application Development using .NET Framework

Since we are using Custom Methods on WebGet with datas coming 
from the stored procedures though following existing query option standard 
in the RESO Implementation we are not able to use any existing client library 
for oData  processing.

The code is built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2013
with OData v3 capabilities.
